<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hello! I’m Perry Kim, a passionate learner and aspiring web developer with a
  strong foundation in networking and cloud solutions. With years of experience
  as a Network Support Specialist and certifications like CCNA and Security+,
  I’ve honed my problem-solving skills and developed a knack for building
  efficient and scalable solutions.
</p>

<p>
  Now, I’m channeling that expertise into crafting dynamic websites and
  full-stack applications. I’m currently diving deep into JavaScript and web
  development, fueled by a desire to create seamless digital experiences. My
  goal is to merge my technical background with my growing skill set in web
  development to build tools and applications that make a difference.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not coding or tinkering with new technologies, I’m probably exploring
  new ways to improve my craft, learning Spanish, or working on personal
  projects that push me closer to my dream role as a professional web developer.
</p>

<p>
  Thanks for stopping by my portfolio. Let’s create something amazing together!
